                    <p2>Hey! I'm Conor Cresswell. I'm an Illustrator, Visual/UI Designer, music lover and part time game enthusiast. Born and bred in Buckinghamshire, I'm currently at the University of Winchester studying Digital Media Design. If my eyes aren't glued to a screen, they're normally glued into my sketchbook as all of my work starts on paper. Inspired by illustrators such as Jamie Hewlett, my work is heavily focused on Graphic Design and Illustration. During my time at University however, i've begun to move into UI and Visual Design. Here, you'll find a mixture of projects i've completed whilst being at University and through my own Freelance work</p2>

                            <img src="img/bear/inspiration.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>The project began when I found a <a href ="http://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/tutorials/photoshop/create-iconic-t-shirt-artwork">step-by-step guide</a> to creating vector illustrations using Photoshop and Illustrator together. I really liked the attention to detail the illustration had and I wanted to incorporate this into one of my own drawings.</p>

                            <img src="img/bear/researchbear.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>After reading through the guide, I began to design my own illustration on paper. To do this, I used <a href ="https://uk.pinterest.com/conorcresswell/t-shirt-designs/">Pinterest</a> to research different vector illustrations. I use Pinterest for a lot of different project so it was my first place for research. </p>

                             <img src="img/bear/bear_sketch1.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>After researching, I began to sketch a wolf, a bear and other native american animals. In the guide, they suggested to draw one half then using Photoshop to make the photo symmetrical. This would make it easier to draw in Illustrator.</p>

                             <img src="img/bear/bear_sketch2.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>Continuing on, some of the sketches focused on a specific section. This was as I like to draw different things for a project, then accumulate them into one illustration digitally.</p>

                             <img src="img/bear/bear_sketch3.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>Here are some more sketches.</p>

                             <img src="img/bear/bear_sketch4.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>Some additional sketches here showing off alternative ideas for different t-shirt designs that might appear in the future.</p>
                            
                             <img src="img/bear/bear_dev1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>After taking some of the sketches into Photoshop, I exported them as one image. This image was then used to draw over using the pen tool in Illustrator. After drawing one side of the bear, I duplicated one side of the face, flipped it then fused them together to look like one face. </p>

                             <img src="img/bear/bear_dev2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>After getting feedback from some of my peers in the design studio I was working in. I was told that it didn't look much like a bear at this point so I went onto Google to look at real bears. I then altered the illustration to make it more realistic. After this, I developed a colour scheme that would be used and painted this underneath the illustration on a separate layer in Illustrator.</p>

                             <img src="img/bear/bear_dev3.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>After completing the main face, I went back to the sketches of the spears then went through a similar development process in creating it. Doing the outlines first and making sure it was symmetrical. Some of the staff sections of the spears I intentionally made asymmetrical as wood isn't naturally symmetrical.</p>

                            <img src="img/bear/mock.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>After finalising the design both with and without colour. I found a Photoshop Smart Object mock up that I could use to show the design on a t-shirt. Adding feathers underneath the head of the spear to add to the native american influence on the illustration.</p>

                            <img src="img/bear/mock2.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>I was also given the opportunity to have this illustration printed onto a canvas bag for out End of Year Show. I took advantage of this to further understand how the illustration would look on different products. Overall I am pleased with the outcome of this project. Pushing myself to do something that I have not done before with any of my illustrations. I will continue to design different t-shirt designs with the hope of selling them commercially online through a third-party service. </p>

                            <p>The brief was to illustrate and create a childrens book for children ages 2 to 4. The story was already given to me by the client with some suggestions of images however I had to includesome of my own ideas to finish the project.</p>

                            <img src="img/different/brainstorm.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>Once I was given the brief, I took the time to explore this brief using an brainstorm.</p>

                            <img src="img/different/Research_1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>In order to gain an understanding of book illustration and childrens books I did some research using different resources.</p>

                              <img src="img/different/Research_2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>I continued to research different illustrators and writers.</p>

                              <img src="img/different/Research_3.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>Additional research images.</p>

                            <img src="img/different/Character1.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>After doing research on multiple different illustrators and writers; I began to create these sketches digitally using a variety of tools to develop them further.</p>

                            <img src="img/different/Character2.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>I experimented with different styles based on the illustrators I looked at. For example, within my sketchbook there is a page dedicated to characters based on Dr. Seuss' ilustration style.</p>

                            <img src="img/different/Character3.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>I illustrated characters that used similar physical attributes however I would change them based on the style I was attempting to mimic. For example, the mother character in some has large curly hair then in others she has straight hair.</p>

                            <img src="img/different/branding-01.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>Moving away from the characters, I decided to look at overall branding for the book. Taking into consideration the different fonts that could be used. The font I ended up using is in the bottom right corner of the image below. I chose this one above the others as it was the most legible font. I couldn't allow myself to get carried away with the design and not forget the purpose of the product.</p>

                             <img src="img/different/branding-02.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>I also experimented with different colour schemes for the book. This was done after the font was chosen therefore it had to compliment this and the target audience of 2 to 4 year old girls.</p>

                            <img src="img/different/experiementation.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>After creating multiple sketches, I decided to take them all onto the computer using Adobe Illustrator to recreate them. I woulc also use this software to experiment with the style of the character's further. </p>

                             <img src="img/different/layout1.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>By this point in the project, I had hit a metaphorical brick wall in my designing. I was unsure of where to go next. Luckily, I had a peer evaluation presentation and was offered some advice. The biggest piece of advice I took was looking at real childrens books from the library and looking through them.</p>

                            <img src="img/different/layout2.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>The books I looked at where The Cat in the Hat, The Gruffalo, A Great Day to Up and Are you my Mother?.</p>

                            <img src="img/different/layout3.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>I read through these books, going through each page and analysing it. Gathering an understanding of things such asas to why they have put text in certain places, why they place the image on the left istead of the right and how they used the book itself to impact the story.</p>

                            <img src="img/different/layout4.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>These notes where very useful at the development of my project.</p>

                              <img src="img/different/layout5.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>Additional research of layout.</p>

                             <img src="img/different/Sketch.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>After gathering additional research from library books, I began to illustrate the characters and scenes that would appear in the book. Placing characters I had designed into new environments based on the script in the story.</p>

                             <img src="img/different/Sketch2.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>Taking some of the points raised in the story quite literally to add humour to the story that was outside of the text.</p>

                             <img src="img/different/Sketch3.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>Illustrating objects such as castles, beds and other furniture from different perspectives was a struggle I faced as I am not too comfortable with 3D sketching. 

                            <img src="img/different/covermock.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>I decided to mock up a cover for the book in the portrait layout using the font and colour schemes I had chosen. </p>

                             <img src="img/different/illustrations.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>
                                I then began to finalse all the illustrations for the book. Using the sketches as templates to build upon in Adobe Illustrator. Personally, I am not pleased with the final outcome for this project. I began to loose interest in it part way through and it slowly became a chore to complete. Additionally the quality of the illstrations are not as well executed as I know I can achieve. However I am extremely pleased with my effort to include more research for this project. Going through the proccesses that I have been learning of the last three years of my education at university. Using sketches to develop characters and ideas. I have learned a lot from this project and I won't make the same mistakes as I did.
