                    <p2>Hey! I'm Conor Cresswell. I'm an Illustrator, Visual/UI Designer, music lover and part time game enthusiast. Born and bred in Buckinghamshire, I'm currently at the University of Winchester studying Digital Media Design. If my eyes aren't glued to a screen, they're normally glued into my sketchbook as all of my work starts on paper. Inspired by illustrators such as Jamie Hewlett, my work is heavily focused on Graphic Design and Illustration. During my time at University however, i've begun to move into UI and Visual Design. Here, you'll find a mixture of projects i've completed whilst being at University and through my own Freelance work</p2>

                            <hr>
                            
                            <p>The brief for this project came from the Royal Society of Arts’ Student Design Awards brief number 11 called “Learning for Life”. This brief can be found here… <p>

                            <p>After reading the brief and taking notes I decided on the target audience of individuals between the ages of 55 and 66. This was an area I was made aware of within the brief itself. The basic premise of the project is to design a solution that would encourage, empower and promote self-directed learning outside of conventional places such as work or school. <p>

                            <hr>
                            <h2>Research</h2>
                            <hr>
                                        
                            <p>Creating profiles of alternative target audiences was a method I found useful as it allowed me to think about what users would want and need from a solution. I considered including a target audience of graduates who have gone into full-time work but want to continue to learn.<p>

                            <p>I decided to leave the graduate target audience and solely focus on the elderly as my primary users. This was there are already existing grad-schemes available to graduates to help them get into work. However there is not as much support for those older people who are unemployed or have recently been made redundant. My solution would therefore be beneficial to them more than the graduates.<p>
                            
                            <p>After deciding on this target audience, I thought about what the solution would be. An initial idea was to create a website that users could log onto. However I thought that gathering some primary research from the users would help form my ideas. The results showed that users would feel comfortable using a mobile or tablet device. 12 of the 13 people who took the survey had and use a mobile device on a daily basis so weren’t afraid of using it.<p>

                            <p>As the idea began to sway towards an application, I decided to do some research on user centered design and found a variation on Mazlow’s Hierarchy of Needs that focused on design. The pillars of this where Functionality, Reliability, Usability, Proficiency and Creativity. I focused this on the introduction of new features into an app. <p>
                            
                            <p>From this, I thought for my own project that it would best be suited as a cycle rather than a pyramid. Meaning that whenever a new feature is introduced, it can be tested against all of the pillars and therefore have purpose within the application.<p>

                            <p>After this, I had the idea of creating a to-do-list app that would give users the management tools to accomplish the tasks they wanted rather than giving them pre-set tasks. I then looking into competitors that are already on the market such as Productive and Streak. Taking things I liked and improving upon the problems of these helped form the basis of my ideas.<p>
                                    
                            <p>As the idea was forming for my solution to be a learning application, I undertook some research in learner types and how people learn. In The Learning Pyramid, those that learn by practical methods retain 75% of the task they have done. Also learning that adults learners are generally self-directed learners, this justified the nature of my solution.<p>

                            <hr>
                            <h2>Initial Ideas</h2>
                            <hr>
                            
                            <p>After looking at Streak and Productive, I formed my own ideas about what features to be included within the app and began to wireframe a basic template.<p>



<p>Then, I took all the features I thought would be useful to the product and created a full wireframe of the mobile application. This wasn’t meant to be a concrete choice but just to see what it could potentially look like, then use that as a point of reference when refining the design later.<p>



<p>Another aspect of this project I wanted to focus on was create a brand that truly represented the application I wanted to build. This started out by thinking back to my colour theory lessons from my undergraduate degree to form basic branding ideas. I thought about what the name should be, what the app should represent and the call-to-action.<p>



<p>The three ideas I came up with for the brand was an elephant, a lemon and a hammer. The elephant is normally symbolised as an animal that ‘never forgets’. Also the idea of the matriarch elephant that leads the herd because she has the most experience really inspired the idea. The lemon came from the phrase ‘When life gives you lemons’ so linking to the fact I wanted users to take control of their learning. Finally the hammer was meant to symbolise the idea of ‘striking while the iron is hot’. <p>



<p>After sketching a number of ideas, I decided that the hammer logo was not as strong of a branding choice as the other two ideas.<p>


<p>After eliminating the hammer idea, I refined a couple of logo designs I liked and began to think of names for these brands. <p>



<p>I then took those drawings from my sketchbook and moved them into Adobe Illustrator so I could turn them into editable vector graphics.<p>


<p>I then began to add colour to my logos and begin to think about what fonts should be used with each logo design. I also decided on the names for my branding ideas. The elephant logo would be called Mammoth and the lemon would just be called Lemon.<p>



<p>This was the final logo idea I went with. I chose this over the Lemon design because after adding colours and building out each brand; the Mammoth design was stronger. The colours could represent the goals of the application better. The font and colours were easier to read and for my target audience; accessibility is key.<p>

                            <p>The majority of my project would be made using Adobe Experience Design. This rapid prototyping tool would be extremely useful in creating my product and making a mock up.<p>

                            <p>Whilst developing the site in Adobe XD, I thought about what the icons would look like. Understanding that I didn’t need to create something brand new otherwise that would confuse the users. If something works; stick with it.<p>

For this project however, I took that logo design a step further to create a website and develop the brand as a whole.</p>

                            <p>The module I completed this project for was called Emerging Media. The purpose of which was to focus of which was to collaborate with other practitioners both in and out of the digital media industry. I thought of a couple of ideas but decided on building the Winchester Silverbacks brand as it would allow me to focus my efforts on something I am extremely passionate about.<p>

                            <p>As I would be working and leading a group of people to complete this task. I did some research on the governance of collaboration.<p>

                            <p>An idea that was formed early on was the idea of having a website. This was something that I was keen on doing because it would expand my skills in that area. I started by looking at already existing websites for teams in the local area and took notes on what features I liked.<p>

                            <p>I wrote down the goals and problems that the team were facing. The basis was that the team would be acquiring full american football kit and we needed ways to get that information out to potential new players.<p>

                            <p>The project began when I found a <a href ="http://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/tutorials/photoshop/create-iconic-t-shirt-artwork">step-by-step guide</a> to creating vector illustrations using Photoshop and Illustrator together. I really liked the attention to detail the illustration had and I wanted to incorporate this into one of my own drawings.</p>

                            <p>After reading through the guide, I began to design my own illustration on paper. To do this, I used <a href ="https://uk.pinterest.com/conorcresswell/t-shirt-designs/">Pinterest</a> to research different vector illustrations. I use Pinterest for a lot of different project so it was my first place for research. </p>

                            <p>After researching, I began to sketch a wolf, a bear and other native american animals. In the guide, they suggested to draw one half then using Photoshop to make the photo symmetrical. This would make it easier to draw in Illustrator.</p>

                            <p>Continuing on, some of the sketches focused on a specific section. This was as I like to draw different things for a project, then accumulate them into one illustration digitally.</p>

                            <p>Here are some more sketches.</p>

                            <p>Some additional sketches here showing off alternative ideas for different t-shirt designs that might appear in the future.</p>
                            
                             <img src="img/bear/bear_dev1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>After taking some of the sketches into Photoshop, I exported them as one image. This image was then used to draw over using the pen tool in Illustrator. After drawing one side of the bear, I duplicated one side of the face, flipped it then fused them together to look like one face. </p>

                             <img src="img/bear/bear_dev2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>After getting feedback from some of my peers in the design studio I was working in. I was told that it didn't look much like a bear at this point so I went onto Google to look at real bears. I then altered the illustration to make it more realistic. After this, I developed a colour scheme that would be used and painted this underneath the illustration on a separate layer in Illustrator.</p>

                             <img src="img/bear/bear_dev3.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>After completing the main face, I went back to the sketches of the spears then went through a similar development process in creating it. Doing the outlines first and making sure it was symmetrical. Some of the staff sections of the spears I intentionally made asymmetrical as wood isn't naturally symmetrical.</p>

                            <img src="img/bear/mock.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>After finalising the design both with and without colour. I found a Photoshop Smart Object mock up that I could use to show the design on a t-shirt. Adding feathers underneath the head of the spear to add to the native american influence on the illustration.</p>

                            <img src="img/bear/mock2.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>I was also given the opportunity to have this illustration printed onto a canvas bag for out End of Year Show. I took advantage of this to further understand how the illustration would look on different products. Overall I am pleased with the outcome of this project. Pushing myself to do something that I have not done before with any of my illustrations. I will continue to design different t-shirt designs with the hope of selling them commercially online through a third-party service. </p>
