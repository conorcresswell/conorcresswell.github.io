	<h3>About Me</h3>

	<div class="about">
		
		<p>Hey! I'm Conor Cresswell. I'm an Illustrator, Visual/UI Designer, music lover and part time game enthusiast. Born and bred in Buckinghamshire, I'm currently at the University of Winchester studying Digital Media Design. If my eyes aren't glued to a screen, they're normally glued into my sketchbook as all of my work starts on paper. Inspired by illustrators such as Jamie Hewlett, my work is heavily focused on Graphic Design and Illustration. During my time at University however, i've begun to move into UI and Visual Design. So far I mainly use Adobe software such as Photoshop, Illustrator with some experience using After Effects. On my portfolio site, you'll find a mixture of projects i've completed whilst being at University and through Freelance work.
